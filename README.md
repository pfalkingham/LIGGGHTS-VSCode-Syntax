# LIGGGHTS-VSCode-Syntax
Syntax file for Visual Studio Code to add syntax highlighting for LIGGGHTS (www.cfdem.com) input files

This is pretty basic and made just for my needs (I don't use all functions of liggghts) but it can easily be expanded with mroe keywords.

To use as-is, download the \*.vsix file and install to VSCode
